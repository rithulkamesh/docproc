    """Abstract base class for file writers that support incremental data writing.

    Defines the interface for writers that can export data to various file formats.
    Provides context manager support and progress tracking functionality.

    This class should be subclassed to implement specific file format writers
    (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML). All abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.

    Args:
        filename (str): Path to the output file
        progress_callback (Optional[Callable[[int], None]]): Optional callback function
            that accepts the current count of processed items

    Attributes:
        filename (str): Path to the output file
        progress_callback (Optional[Callable[[int], None]]): Callback for progress updates
        _count (int): Number of items processed

    Example:
        ```python
        class CSVWriter(FileWriter):
            def __init__(self, filename: str,
                        progress_callback: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None) -> None:
                super().__init__(filename, progress_callback)
                # CSV-specific initialization

            def write_data(self, data: Iterator[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
                # Implement CSV writing logic
                pass

            def init_tables(self) -> None:
                # Initialize CSV file
